TinyMCE is included as an external reference to a branch.

Here's some step-by-step instructions on how to upgrade to a new version:

1. Go to http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php
2. Download the main package zip file (e.g tinymce_3_2_4_1.zip) and PHP spellchecker (e.g. tinymce_spellchecker_php_2_0_2.zip)
3. Go to http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download_i18n.php
4. Check all available languages, and download and hit download to receive a language pack
5. Create a branch for the new version of TinyMCE. e.g. "svn mkdir svn://svn.silverstripe.com/silverstripe/open/thirdparty/tiny_mce/branches/3.2.4.1"
6. Checkout the empty branch out into a directory on your file system. e.g. "svn co svn://svn.silverstripe.com/silverstripe/open/thirdparty/tiny_mce/branches/3.2.4.1"
7. Copy the main package zip file and language pack zip file into the directory that you just checked out
8. Unpack the main package contents, unpack the language pack into the same directory, overwriting the existing files
9. Find the spellchecker directory in plugins/spellchecker. Unpack the spellchecker files into this directory overwriting any old ones
10. Check that any changes to the old TinyMCE branch need to make their way into the new one
11. Commit all your changes to the branch
12. Update the externals for jsparty ("svn propedit svn:externals ." whilst in the jsparty directory) to reflect the new TinyMCE branch you created
13. SVN update the jsparty folder, and commit the externals "svn commit ."
