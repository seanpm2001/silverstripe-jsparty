# SilverStripe JSParty Module #

This module is only required for legacy versions (2.3 or older) of the [SilverStripe CMS](http://silverstripe.org).
Its components have been removed, or moved into the [sapphire](github.com/silverstripe/sapphire) and [cms](github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cms) modules in newer releases.

Or in other words: "The JSParty is over!"
